Print out the top words in each topic, and read through the words for each topic to decide the theme of the topic: remember this is subjective and there are no right or wrong answers. Print out a few comments with high frequencies of each topic and analyze if your topic labels were representative. "

You’ll be here for years and there is time to form a professional interpersonal relationship.

But they are also the public face of the various offices and departments in the university and it's not unreasonable to hold them to a degree of professionalism commensurate with their position and responsibilities.

This ends up being great when large groups of people with the same end goal make a friend group and continue to help each other out. For example, the physics RSOs lean social, but all the people that show up find friends who will continue to work together in grad school applications, internship applications, etc.\n",

      "Gonna throw my hat into the ring here because this topic has always been interesting (and a bit frustrating, at the fault of nobody in particular) to me as a lead in both an engineering org targeted at women and an ACM SIG lead (obligatory disclaimer my opinions do not reflect my RSOs opinions, I’m speaking as an individual, etc). Women’s orgs (and orgs associated with industry minorities generally speaking, though I can only personally speak for women’s orgs) inherently have a harder job to do with less resources than the average engineering RSO, and I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to expect the same level of depth from them. Let me explain what I mean.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s say the average freshman CS major can join one professional RSO before going crazy. To simplify, we’re gonna say that freshman CS majors can pick between ACM and WCS. ACM is targeted at all genders but in practice is male dominated, and WCS is mostly targeted at women and gender minorities. Let’s say that there are 600 men and 300 women in the incoming freshman CS class. Nearly 100% of freshman men in CS will pick ACM because they don’t necessarily need to seek out their gender to find it in this industry. Let’s say 2/3 of freshman women in CS join WCS and 1/3 join ACM. There are now 700 freshman in ACM and 200 freshman in WCS. As someone who has seen the internals of how clubs get funding, I can tell you both from a sponsorship standpoint and how SODA allocates funds that more attendance means more leverage for financial support. WCS’s job is to do what ACM does with much less people and less funding and *also* to build a strong support system for women in the field while trying to retain a much higher percentage of people to stay afloat (which explains why you tend to see a lot more socials, office hours, etc). In my opinion, this is basically an impossible task. I don’t really have a good, streamlined solution to problems like this, I’ve spent a notable amount of my undergraduate career trying to find just that. That being said, in the meantime I’ve learned to get what I can reasonably expect to get out of women’s engineering RSOs, and looking back I wish I’d gotten more involved with them sooner. \n",
      "\n",
      "I will also say as a final note that I can’t speak for your individual experience on this (or WECE as an org), but in terms of discourse or drama, the grass is not always greener on the other side. I love both my RSOs and generally have no issues with them but the closer you get to the top of clubs like this, the more hard directional choices you have to make, the more you see go down, the more time you see wasted on stuff that doesn’t matter, etc. Regardless of the breadth of shenanigans I’ve seen over time, I wouldn’t trade the effort I’ve put into either of them for the world.\n",

The administration's hesitance and reluctance to share this information with us leads us to believe the investments are directly going against the cause and towards military operations in Israel. We are asking for complete transparency because as students spending thousands of dollars going to this institution, that should not even be something that requires this much deliberation. Some partnerships are and could be weaker links, which is why we ask, what is the point of the partnership in the first place?

But there needs to be a contractual agreement that the institution will only fund those 5 things. The 6th, providing weapons to Israel, will be unacceptable. I understand that in this day and age, it is difficult to completely divest from corporations that supply other countries, regardless of if you agree with their policies or not.

They tow your car, and then pretty much are free to set the conditions on how you can get your vehicle back...such as charging $300/day for storage. If you can't immediately get your vehicle back, you're basically fucked. Don't wanna pay? Then they are legally allowed to auction your vehicle after 30 days.  You, the driver, have basically zero recourse than to do whatever the towing company wants from you.

      "I had quite bad social anxiety as a teen and struggled to make friends most of my life, being a total loner until I was 20. (Not that it's easy now, but it's not as impossible-seeming.) I would recommend trying to do at least one social thing a week (or every two weeks, do what is most manageable to you) that is slightly outside of your comfort zone, such as greeting a classmate/hallmate/random person, or attending a campus event. This is essentially exposure therapy and it'll slowly make it less intimidating to socialize with strangers. Making friends is just about impossible if you never initiate interactions (though some of my favorite friends were more extroverted people who did approach me first). This way, you can put yourself out there more and increase your chances of meeting someone you're socially compatible with. It doesn't guarantee friends, and I know it's exhausting to socialize with random people and not \"get\" anything meaningful out of it like a friend, but it's what'll make it easier to make friends. Also, here's a tip, [a study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2021/09/deep-conversations-strangers) published through the American Psychological Association found that, \"People overestimate awkwardness, underestimate enjoyment of deep, meaningful conversations\" (just bring up deep conversation topics with people, the majority of the time both you and the other person will enjoy it way more than you expected).\n",

For your money, South Asian diet is best bang for the buck, and you can freeze what you don't eat for later, especially if you are only cooking for one person. 3) meat tends to fluctuate in price, but pork, chicken legs or ground turkey tend to be most inexpensive; tuna is relatively inexpensive.  4) the perimeter of the grocery store tends to be less expensive. Things like chips, individually wrapped snacks,, cereal, etc are stupidly expensive right now.  The trade of in the cost of healthy/homemade food is that it can be time consuming to cook it.

Going back to campus might be a little more difficult. I think you would need to leave next day. For BETS in 2022 they ended the show almost at 11 and most transportation back to campus isn’t available that late. I think last Amtrak train back to campus leaves at 10pm. Easiest option to avoid going from Rosemont to Chicago to uiuc would be to take Peoria charter. They make a stop @ O’Hare which is really close to Allstate and drop offs are at Illinois terminal, ISR, and Armory.
